The server folder contains basically the code for the registry interface. 
	The most important file is called the 'server.py' containing the implementation of the operations of the API. 
	There are two files containing python dictionaries which are used to save and reload cache information about the authority hierarchies. 
	The 'slice' and 'component' folders contain the keys of each authority in hierarchy.

The gui directory is the client part. 
	There is a GUI in java, but the authentication logic and function calls are all in a file called 'clientstub.py'. This file is found in 'gui/JavaApplication1/client_osaka' directory. 
	'client_osaka' and 'client_keiko' are just two example client folders that we use to test the interfaces.

util folder contains almost all of the core code. 
	'tree.py' is important for setting up a hierarchy of authorities corresponding to PlanetLab sites. As noted before, you can find the generated hierarchy under the folder in server folder, with names 'slice' and 'component' folders.
	sec folder under util is the security module. 'sec.py' contains both the authentication/authorization related functions (used while a new connection is being established), also certificate related functions (credentials creation, etc). 
	Other files are util code for PlanetLab to GENI conversion logic, database and exceptions.
