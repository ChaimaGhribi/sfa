RSpecs
- RSpecConverter should convert sliver tags
- SM should cache result of Aggregte GetVersion call when CreateSliver is executed
- CreateSlivers should update SliverTags/attributes 

Registry
- Verify that sub authority certificates still work


Stop invalid users
  * a recently disabled/deleted user may still have a valid cred. Keep a list of valid/invalid users on the aggregate and check callers against this list

Component manager
  * install trusted certs when interface starts (component_manager_pl.init_server())
  * Redeem ticket - RedeemTicket/AdminTicket not working. Why?
  ** This may be replaced by sfa + credentials  

GUI/Auth Service
  * develop a simple service where users auth using username/passord and 
    receive their cred
  * service manages users key/cert,creds
  * gui requires user's cred (depends on Auth Service above)
