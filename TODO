RSpecs
- CreateSlivers should update SliverTags/attributes 
- ProtoGENI rspec integration testing
- initscripts in the rspec

Registry
- Verify that sub authority certificates still work


Component manager
  * install trusted certs when interface starts (component_manager_pl.init_server())
  * Redeem ticket - RedeemTicket/AdminTicket not working. Why?
  ** This may be replaced by sfa + credentials  

GUI/Auth Service
  * develop a simple service where users auth using username/passord and 
    receive their cred
  * service manages users key/cert,creds
  * gui requires user's cred (depends on Auth Service above)
