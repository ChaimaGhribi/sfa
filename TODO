- test rpms: build/install

- Stop invalid users
* a recently disabled/deleted user may still have a valid cred. Keep a list of valid/invalid users on the aggregate and check callers against this list

- Component manager
  * GetTicket - must verify_{site,slice,person,keys} on remote aggregate 
  * Redeem ticket - RedeemTicket/AdminTicket not working. Why?
  * install the slice and node gid when the slice is created (create NM plugin to execute sfa_component_setup.py ?) 

- Protogeni
* agree on standard set of functon calls
* agree on standard set of privs
* on permission error, return priv needed to make call
* cache slice resource states (if aggregate goes down, how do we know what
  slices were on it and recreate them? do we make some sort of transaction log)   

- Registry
* sign peer gids 
* update call should attempt to push updates to federated peers if 
  the peer has a record for an object that is updated locally  
* api.update_membership() shoudl behave more like resolve when looking up records (attempt to resolve records at federated registeries) instead of only looking in the local registry
* move db tables into db with less overhead (tokyocabinet?)
* make resolve, fill_record_info more fault tolerent. Skip records with failures

- Auth Service
  * develop a simple service where users auth using username/passord and 
    receive their cred
  * service manages users key/cert,creds
  
- GUI
  * requires user's cred (depends on Auth Service above)
      
-  SM call routing
* sfi -a option should send request to sm with an extra argument to 
  specify which am to contact instead of connecting directly to the am 
  (am may not trust client directly)

-  Initscripts on sfa / geniwrapper
* should sfa have native initscript support or should we piggyback off of myplc?
* should this be in the rspec
