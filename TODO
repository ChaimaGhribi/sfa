- URN vs HRN
* methods should support urn or hrn arguments
* create a module that converts urn to hrn so we can continue using
  hrn behind the scenes  
* add get_urn() method to GID object 
* urn is the standard over the wire format

- Registry
* refactor to use managers
* update call should attempt to push updates to federated peers if 
  the peer has a record for an object that is updated locally  
* api.update_membership() shoudl behave more like resolve when looking up records (attempt to resolve records at federated registeries) instead of only looking in the local registry
*  sfi remove, if removing a site, remove any record that site is an an authority for
* support generic registry records (dont depend on postgres! object db?)
* modify resolve() so that you can resolve more than 1 hrn at at time (list of hrns) 

-  sfa-clean-peer-records 
* instead of resolving each peer record one by one, use one reslove call to resolve a list of hrns (requires updated registry.resolve() method)

- Aggregate
* sfa.plc.slices.verify_site() should check if site['max_slices'] needs to be updated
* sfa.plc.slices.verify_slice() should check if slice['expires'] needs to be updated
 
- Component manager
* install the slice and node gid when the slice is created (create NM plugin to execute sfa_component_setup.py ?) 

    
-  SM call routing
* sfi -a option should send request to sm with an extra argument to 
  specify which am to contact instead of connecting directly to the am 
  (am may not trust client directly)

-  Initscripts on sfa / geniwrapper
* should sfa have native initscript support or should we piggyback off of myplc?

-  Fully integrate SOAP (need to throw either soap or xmlrpc exceptions depending on the client)
* started but not finished

- error messages
* error messages should be easier to understand
* (failing to connect to plcapi shoudl return a helpful message, not a generic internal server error)
