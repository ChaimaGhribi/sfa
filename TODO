- Registry
* update call shuold attempt to push updates to federated peers if 
* the peer has a record for an object that is updated locally  

- Component manager
* install the  slice and node gid when the slice is created (create NM plugin to execute sfa_component_setup.py ?) 

- GetTicket
* sm, am only
* sm calls getticket on am and merges resulting tickets into 1 ticket

-  sfa-clean-peer-records 
* modify resolve to support a list of hrns
* resolve a list of peer hrns instead of each hrn individally

-  sfi remove, if removing a site, remove any record that site is an an authority for

-  routing sm calls
* sfi -a option should send request to sm with an extra argument to 
  specify which am to contact instead of connecting directly to the am 
  (am may not trust client directly)

- make registry more generic
* support interface managers
* support generic registry records (dont depend on postgres! object db?)

- checking support for conventional ssl (creating a shared keypair for the request)        

-  Initscripts on sfa / geniwrapper

-  Fully integrate SOAP (need to throw either soap or xmlrpc exceptions depending on the client)

- error messages
* error messages should be easier to understand
* (failing to connect to plcapi shoudl return a helpful message, not a generic internal server error) 

- unit tests
