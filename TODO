- Tag
* test rpm build/install

- Trunk
* use PLC shell instead of xmlrpc when communicating with local plc aggregate

- Client
  * update getNodes to use lxml.etree for parsing the rspec

- Stop invalid users
* a recently disabled/deleted user may still have a valid cred. Keep a list of valid/invalid users on the aggregate and check callers against this list

- Component manager
  * GetGids - make this work for peer slices
  * GetTicket - must verify_{site,slice,person,keys} on remote aggregate 
  * Redeem ticket - RedeemTicket/AdminTicket not working. Why?
  * install the slice and node gid when the slice is created (create NM plugin to execute sfa_component_setup.py ?) 

- Registry
* move db tables into db with less overhead (tokyocabinet?)

- GUI/Auth Service
  * develop a simple service where users auth using username/passord and 
    receive their cred
  * service manages users key/cert,creds
  * gui requires user's cred (depends on Auth Service above)
      
-  SM call routing
* sfi -a option should send request to sm with an extra argument to 
  specify which am to contact instead of connecting directly to the am 
  (am may not trust client directly)

- Protogeni
* merger josh's branch with trunk
* agree on standard set of functon calls
* agree on standard set of privs
* on permission error, return priv needed to make call
* cache slice resource states (if aggregate goes down, how do we know what
  slices were on it and recreate them? do we make some sort of transaction log)


Questions
=========
- SM/Aggregate
* should the rspec contain only the resources a slice is using or all resources availa and mark what the slice is using.

-  Initscripts on sfa / geniwrapper
* should sfa have native initscript support or should we piggyback off of myplc?
* should this be in the rspec
